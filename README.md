# resolve-up [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/resolve-up.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/resolve-up)

> Resolve paths to globally installed npm modules using glob patterns.

## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i resolve-up --save
```

## Usage

```js
var resolveup = require('resolve-up');
console.log(resolveup('generator-*'));
```

Results in an array of module directories like:

```js
[ '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/generator-foo',
  '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/generator-bar',
  '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/generator-baz' ]
```

This only returns directories so you can loop over them and create your own logic to get what you need.


## Filter function

You can also pass a filter function as the last argument. Note that the function will be used to eliminate paths **before the remaining paths are tested against the glob patterns**.

```js
var generators = resolveup('generator-*', function(segment, fp, stat) {
  // `segment` - the current directory or file name being looped over
  // `fp` - the full, absolute file path
  // `fs.stat` object
});
```


## Run tests
Install dev dependencies:

```bash
npm i -d && npm test
```
