# resolve-up [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/resolve-up.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/resolve-up)

> Resolve paths to globally installed npm modules using glob patterns. Very fast, great for getting paths to yeoman generators, etc.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i resolve-up --save
```

## Usage

```js
var resolveup = require('resolve-up');
console.log(resolveup('generator-*'));
```

Results in an array of module directories like:

```js
[ '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/generator-foo',
  '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/generator-bar',
  '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/generator-baz' ]
```

This only returns directories so you can loop over them and create your own logic to get what you need.

## symlinks

Pass `{ nosymlinks: true }` on the options to ignore symlinked directories.

```js
var resolveup = require('resolve-up');
console.log(resolveup('generator-*', {nosymlinks: true}));
```

## Filter function

You can also pass a filter function as the last argument. Note that the function will be used to eliminate paths **before the remaining paths are tested against the glob patterns**.

```js
var generators = resolveup('generator-*', function(segment, fp, stat) {
  // `segment` - the current directory or file name being looped over
  // `fp` - the full, absolute file path
  // `fs.stat` object
});
```
